Flash floods are the most recent natural calamity that took Indians worldwide by a storm. Our inability to predict them as they flood the low lying areas within 6 hours of the rain, cloudburst or glacier melting upstream is what makes them one of the most destructive natural calamities. However, massive loss of life and property they cause is due to a lack of centralized warning system.

The immense loss of life in tragedies like the recent Kerala floods or the infamous Kedarnath tragedy could have been avoided if the authorities and locals were alerted of the incoming wrath. With massive amounts of data from the meteorological departments regarding rain upstream and humidity content in soil, and assistance of high edge data analysis tools like Azure Blobs and application development softwares like Silverlight we, Team Nira, plan to not only predict these flash floods but also alert the police, ambulance departments, and the possible affected population beforehand through text alerts, legally extracting the database from the local phone directory and the resident list of such sensitive areas.

The application not just restrict itself to giving alerts but also provides the real-time data and the probability of the occurrence of a flash flood based on data analysis. Even those who do not have this application will be alerted via text messages if such a situation is predicted.
